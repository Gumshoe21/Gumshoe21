## Welcome!

### A bit about me

- JavaScript/TypeScript developer.
- I love CSS.
- 
- I use NeoVim (because what else would someone use?)
- I'm learning about web accessibility ([WAI-ARIA](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria), [a11y](https://www.a11yproject.com), etc.) and plan on making all my future websites and apps as accessible and inclusive as possible!
